            <p class="textContent">Hi, I'm Samuel and I am currently aspiring to become a front end web-developer. My focus presently is on honing my skills with vanilla JavaScript and CSS, with the intention of finding some projects I
                can use to learn about some libaries and frameworks in the future.
            </p>
            <p class="textContent">When I'm not kicking myself for finding that the error in my code was just a typo I am enjoying time with my wife and daughter, making things with physical tools, running or trying to get somewhere on two wheels.</p>

                <h3 class="hTag">Noughts and Crosses</h3>
                <p class="textContent description">After setting up a simple computer opponent and adding the option to play against another person I took the opportunity to expand my use of CSS animations with this project. While nothing fancy I feel Iâ€™ve been able to make a game that plays smoothly and that is well presented by using animations, also this should allow me to go onto to use them in more interesting ways in the future.</p>

                <p class="textContent description">While the name may be a bit misleading this is a pixel based drawing app that I am fairly proud of. Having learned from some mistakes in creating brush controls for a canvas based drawing app I feel I managed to make it easy for the user to select their inputs and make it all look much better too. That said not having to try and add brush shape selections meant I had less to concentrate on.</p>
