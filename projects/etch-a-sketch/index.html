                <h3 class="hTag">Where I started</h3>
                <p class="textContent">This project is oneI did due to working through The Odin Project, which meant I had abrief giving me a guide of what the finished project should look like and some ideas for extra features I could add. This is also why something that seems to have very little in common with an etch-a-sketch has been given that title.</p>
                <h3 class="hTag">How it changed</h3>
                <p class="textContent">Due to the brief given before starting the project there weren’t any note worthy changes while making the project. This isn’t only thanks to The Odin Projects brief, my having already made a <a href="#">drawing app</a> using html canvas meant I was aware of mistakes I’d already made. Most importantly that I didn’t need to implement my own colour picker as I could use the browsers built in one (the one I made is still on my other drawing app).</p>
                <h3 class="hTag">How I improved</h3>
                <p class="textContent">This project allowed me to improve my event bubbling and capture knowledge as it was thefirst time since getting a proper understanding of them it was able to make a difference in something I was working on. It enabled me to have an event listener on just the grid container element rather than having to attach it to each grid cell every time the grid is re sized.</p>
