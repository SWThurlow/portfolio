          <h3 class="">Where I started</h3>
          <p class="textContent">This was another project from the Odin Project syllabus, this one for using factory functions and modules. At first my goal was to simply get a three by three grid set up where the player could play against the computer, while managing to keep my code contained to modules or factory functions. I wasn’t fussed about the computer playing well so was happy to simply let it select a square at random to play in each turn.</p>
          <h3 class="">How it changed</h3>
          <p class="textContent">After getting a simple game to get the computer to work the next addition was for an option to play against another person. Which fortunately wasn’t too taxing a task, meaning I was soon able to focus on making it look good. </p>
          <p class="textContent">Once I had managed to picking a colour scheme, which I'm still not sure about, I set about adding some animations to let the game selection feel less jolting. This was a fun addition  as CSS animations are something I frequently find myself liking the idea of being able to do interesting things with to liven up my projects but up until this project haven’t taken the opportunity to use that much. Hopefully in the future I will be able to take the time to use animations for things more entertaining than fading elements in or out. </p>
          <h3 class="">How I improved</h3>
          <p class="textContent">Besides the getting to use factory functions and modules properly in a project I came to realise how many line s of code adding and removing classes for animations adds. Fortunately I was able to make a module with functions to change elements to either visible or hidden which managed to roughly half the number of lines of code needed for the animations.</p>
