                <h2 class="hTag">About this project</h2>
                <h3 class="hTag">Where I started</h3>
                <p class="textContent">I started thisproject due to my working through The Odin Project’s syllabus.Having read the brief on what they wanted the calculator to do Imanaged to figure out the basics of the javascript for the projectwith a pen and paper writing, and often scribbling out, pseudo code.This allowed me to do a very basic, both in terms of aesthetics and functionality, calculator very quickly.</p>
                <h3 class="hTag">How it changed</h3>
                <p class="textContent">The project quicklystarted to change lots after managing to get a very basic version of it made. One of the first things to change was the appearance. Itdidn’t go straight to how it presently looks, I had to make place the buttons in a grid and set a background colour to the calculator to make it easier to look at while testing out the various changes I was making in the javascript.</p>
                <p class="textContent">With the calculator, slightly, less offensive to look at I was able to get on to implementing more functionality, adding buttons for the user to clear all, enter a number that is a decimal, change numbers between negative and positive, to name a couple. </p>
                <p class="textContent">Oddly the part Ifound most difficult was implementing the error messages. The logic for the message if the user tries to divide by zero was easy but for some reason no matter where I moved the logic to or how I choseto write it I couldn’t get it to work if it was for the displaytext being too long without losing some part of the functionality. In the end I resorted to resetting the error message to be blank when the user gives any input. Meaning that before displaying any input the script could check for either error and display the error if necessary or leave the error message blank if neither error had occurred.</p>
                <h3 class="hTag">How I improved</h3>
                <p class="textContent">It’s hard to pick any particular item I ended up learning lots about while making thisproject as most of the difficult parts where resolved through trial and error, and some small amount of sighing and tea drinking. However I do feel the fact that looking at some finished solutions of othersleading to my being more adventurous and taking more time with the design aesthetics is the start of my taking more time with the visualside of projects and hopefully learning and improving lots with design.</p>
