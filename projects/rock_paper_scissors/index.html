            <h3 class="hTag">Where I started</h3>
            <p class="textContent">This project started off as a simple game using prompts and displaying outcomes in the console. While this allowed the making of the game to be not too difficult to start with having prompts pop up and having to view outcomes in the console is far from a user friendly game to play. </p>
            <h3 class="hTag">How it changed</h3>
            <p class="textContent">That lead to my making a fairly basic interface to play the game through, which if I start exploring making digital art work I may make something so that there can be images for each of the actions to make the interface slightly less spartan. The javascript interaction with the interface lead to some more challenging problems with the code such as the game log being able to reach slightly outragous lengths due to my not incorporrating a way to reset the game at first, and my then having to read into removing all of a nodes child elements once I added a button to reset the game. </p>
            <h3 class="hTag">How I improved</h3>
            <p class="textContent">It was pointed out to me that I didnâ€™t need to have as many global variables as I was using at first which led to my learning more aboutand implementing arguments being parsed into functions to prevent unnecessay global variables.</p>
