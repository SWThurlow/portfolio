            <h3 class="hTag">Where I started</h3>
            <p class="textContent">This is a project I first made before I was near putting a portfolio together or trying to learn with any determined direction. In it's first iteration this project was simply being able to click on a canvas element and draw aline so that I could learn the basics of html canvas.</p>
            <h3 class="hTag">How it changed</h3>
            <p class="textContent">I later found myself revisiting the project later on and adding the controls to change the brush shape and size as well as adding a way to pick the colour. I made the colour picker myself and have since learnt I could have just used an input with the type of color rather than making my own, that said I am slightly attached to my slightly odd looking colour picker.</p>
            <h3 class="hTag">How I improved</h3>
            <p class="textContent">This project at the various times I have added to it has helped me improve various bits of knowledge from html form elements, to event listeners and using javascript in conjunction with html elements such as canvas. </p>
            <p class="textContent">Most importantly this project helped me realise that browsers may often already have a better built in solution, since completing this project I have used the browsers built in colour picker (here if you want to see: <a src="../etch-a-sketch/index.html">etch-a-sketch</a>).  </p>
