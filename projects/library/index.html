                <h3 class="hTag">Where I started</h3>
                <p class="textContent">This is another project from the Odin projects syllabus. That meant that the main goal with this project was to help develop more of an understanding of object constructors and classes when the code was later refactored.</p>
                <h3 class="hTag">How it changed</h3>
                <p class="textContent">The main way this project changed was the moving to the use of classes. I struggled with the move to classes due to keeping on getting an error message when trying to call methods. In the end I stopped banging my head against the keyboard and settled for just having the methods as functions outside of the objects.</p>
                <h3 class="hTag">How I improved</h3>
                <p class="textContent">That I either need to find more chances to improve at using class constructors or use factory functions would be the first thing I learnt on this project. Another lesson from this project would be that I need to focus on design more on future projects so that I can rely less on layouts and colour schemes copied from other people.</p>
